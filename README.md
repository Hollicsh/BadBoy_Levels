# BadBoy_Levels

## Features
* Hides whispers from players below a specific level.

## Only certain people are allowed to whisper you
* People on your friends list.
* People that are part of your guild.
* People above the level you choose.
* People you've whispered since you logged on.

Simply, if a "bad" person whispers you, the whisper is blocked (hidden), then you automatically send them a whisper (also hidden) of what level they must be for you to see their whispers.
